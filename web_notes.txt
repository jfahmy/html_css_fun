Web Server notes:
Dynamic site - One were you log in and are served content unique to you. Information is stored in a database behind the scenes, which requires the use of a progamming language to function
Static site - Same content represented to every visitor (only html, css and Javascript based)
Front-end - synonymous with "client-side". It's everything you see in your browser
Back-end - "server-side", interacts with a DB, utilizes backend programming languages

- To access a website the files need to be stored on a computer that is constantly online - this "computer" is know as a web server
Webservers take requests from clients using HTTP protocol
- Browsers are the thing responsible for translating the code that will be displayed. Each browser does this a little bit differently.


HTML Notes:
-HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) controls the structure of the content
- The best HTML creates a logical and readable document without any styles.

-To comment with html you use <!-- -->
-index.html is a special filename and it is convention that every website's main page is named index.html

CSS Notes:
Rule-set:
-selector: what you want to change
-property: what part you want to change
-value: is how you want to change it.
An external style sheet has many advantages over inline styles:
-Helps avoid duplication
-Makes maintenance easier
-Allows you to make a site-wide change in one place
